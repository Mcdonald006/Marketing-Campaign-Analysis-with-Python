# ðŸ“Š Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis (HNG)

This project analyzes marketing campaign data to uncover insights that improve ROI, optimize ad spend, and guide data-driven marketing strategies.


## ðŸ§  Project Overview
The dataset provided by HNG contains key marketing performance metrics such as **CTR, CPC, ROI, and Conversion Rate** across different channels like Social Media, Email, and Paid Search.

The goal of this project was to:
- Identify high- and low-performing campaigns
- Analyze channel effectiveness
- Detect outliers in CPC and ROI
- Recommend strategies to improve marketing performance


## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Inspected and corrected column names and data types  
- Handled missing values and converted `Date` column to datetime  
- Created new calculated columns:
  ```python
  df['CTR'] = (df['Clicks'] / df['Impressions']) * 100

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

1. Social Media and Email Marketing showed the highest CTR.

2. Paid Search had a higher CPC but better conversion rate.

3. Outliers indicated wasted ad spend in some campaigns.

4. ROI improved when budgets were reallocated to cost-effective channels.


## Recommendations

1. Increase spending on high-CTR, low-CPC channels

2. Reevaluate or stop low-ROI campaigns

3. Optimize targeting and creatives via A/B testing

4. Implement real-time tracking and budget adjustments
